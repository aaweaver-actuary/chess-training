# Reusable Chessboard Implementation Plan

> **Status update (May 2024):** This plan now feeds the "Application Layer & UI Readiness"
> workstream in [`docs/strategic-roadmap.md`](./strategic-roadmap.md). Consult that document
> for prioritization and cross-team sequencing; keep this file for the component-level
> objectives and testing strategy.

## Objectives
- Extract a reusable chessboard UI component that can be shared across multiple application contexts (e.g., openings, tactics).
- Provide configuration options (colors, orientation, coordinates display, interaction hooks) to support diverse use cases.
- Encapsulate chessboard-specific state management to minimize duplication and simplify future enhancements.
- Ensure comprehensive automated test coverage so that `make test` continues to pass.

## Architectural Approach
1. **Component Extraction**
   - Identify existing chessboard-related UI elements and consolidate them into a new base component (e.g., `BaseChessboard`).
   - Define a clear public API for rendering, configuration, and event callbacks.
2. **State Management**
   - Implement internal state handling for board positions, selected squares, highlighting, and move history as needed.
   - Expose controlled props to allow consumers to override or synchronize state when required.
3. **Styling & Theming**
   - Support customizable colors, square sizes, and optional overlays through props or a theming system.
   - Ensure responsive design considerations so the chessboard adapts to various layouts.
4. **Extensibility Strategy**
   - Allow feature-specific components (e.g., `TacticsChessboard`, `OpeningsChessboard`) to compose the base component with additional logic.
   - Document extension points and recommended patterns for specialization.

## Testing Strategy
- Add unit tests covering rendering, configuration options, state transitions, and event handling.
- Include snapshot or visual regression tests if available to guard against unintended UI changes.
- Update or add integration tests to validate interactions in contexts where the chessboard is used.
- Run `make test` to verify the workspace passes with the new component and tests.

## Documentation & Adoption
- Provide usage examples and guidelines for configuring the base chessboard component.
- Outline migration steps for existing code to adopt the new component.
- Communicate testing expectations and how to extend the component safely.
